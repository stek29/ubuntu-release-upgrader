  * Port KDE GUIs to native Qt5 versions.
    + pyqt5 is only imported iff the current dist version is not trusty as
      that one had a nasty bug with signals and slots not connecting properly.
    + pyqt4/pykde4 compatibility is retained by fallback handling for the
      pyqt5 import, as well as some version checks switching out kde classes
      for qt classes when using Qt5. Ultimately systems <=utopic will retain
      the same behavior as before.
    + KDE bits replacemed as follows:
      * KIcon -> QIcon::fromTheme
      * KMessageBox -> QMessageBox (using most suitable version from the
        limited feature set of QMB)
      * KApplication -> QApplication
      * i18n -> _()
  * Fix KDE upgrade fetcher GUI
    + Wire up do-release-upgrade with the KDE GUI to actually provide a UI
      when run from a KDE Plasma envrionment
    + Remove all logic that replicated stuff done in do-release-upgrade
      (this primarily includes using MetaRelease to actually conduct the
       version check, the automatic version checks are done by a special
       script that is part of muon, so we do not ever call the fetcher
       manually, and have not done so in at least 5 years)
    + Detangle the Acquire class from the Fetcher class, latter is not
      automatically constructing former any longer but needs to get it
      supplied from the outside (i.e. do-release-upgrade)
    + init arguments of both classes are now alinged with their GTK
      counterparts
    + The designer ui file now uses a QTextBrowser rather than a QTextEdit as
      the user doesn't need to edit anything and the former supports html and
      url opening
    + The fetcher ui file has had all unused widgets removed which makes the
      fetcher dialog have correct spacing
    + The classes now hold a QApp as self.app to reflect the fact that they
      may be constructed in any order and thus may need a QApplication in any
      order. The actually instance is created from a new function that creates
      an instance if there isn't one already. Ultimately this should probably
      become a singleton.
    + The Acquire process can now be aborted properly.
   * Fix translation loading. As all Qt GUIs no prominently feature Qt builtin
     classes with strings (QMessageBox, QButtonBox) we make sure that the
     correct translations are loaded through QTranslator right after creating
     the QApplication instances.
     + ubuntu-release-upgrader-qt now recommends qttranslations5-l10n to
      reflect this on a packaging level
  * Add a new class QUrlOpener to redirect all openUrl calls through sudo -u
    if the GUI is run as root, so that we can start the browsers as the user
    rather than root. This class is used in both the Fetcher and the Upgrader.
    It is a singleton that autoparents to qapp, so a qapp instance needs to be
    available before using the opener.
  * Improve Upgrader GUI
    + Upgrader GUI does not meddle with xauthority anymore and doesn't kill
      adept anymore (mind you, adept hasn't been used in years...)
      Also the meddling seems to have been bugged in one form or the other
      which ultimately prevents us from doing a proper openUrl as the invoking
      user
    + dialog_error.ui has been converted to use QTextBrowser as there is no
      editing need.
    + error dialog size hinting as been adjusted to make sure the window can
      not be resized beyond what is suitable to still display stuff.
    + error dialog window size is adjusted before exec to make sure that
      the window has a suitable default size depending on whether the textview
      is displayed or not
    + dialog_error.ui has had its close button replaced with a standard
      QButtonBox
    + reportBug function has been removed as it is not used anymore (core
      brings up apport regardless and the bug report url is most inconvenient
      and pointless because people will not attach the relevant logs...)
    + openUrl function has been removed as it is not used anymore
    + dialog_changes.ui has had its size hinting adjusted to make sure that
      the window has a suitable default size
    + dialog_changes.ui uses QDialogButtonBox for all buttons now, details is
      derived from Help which is the closest fit as far as standard types are
      concerned
    + The changes dialog now adjusts its size when the details widget is
      hidden, this prevents overly large windows after details was shown once
    + The changes dialog now correctly spaces the labels as well as the icon
      label at the window, this resolves text jumping when showing/hiding the
      details widget which was caused by the labels being pushed towards the
      top to make space for the details, now a space makes that happen all the
      time

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Drop all quirks for upgrades prior to the karmic->lucid upgrade; all

    should not be upgrading directly from such old releases to 13.10 or
    later without going through the intermediate LTS releases, so this is

  * Drop use of base-installer for detecting "recommended" kernels for the

    when more specialized kernel flavors became available on i386 that were
    preferred over the -386 flavor, and in the meantime the code is causing
    wrong results on upgrade for users of UbuntuStudio, which ships a kernel
    flavor that's not known by base-installer.  LP: #1220898.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use Python 3-style print functions.
  * Use "except Exception as e" syntax rather than the old-style "except
    Exception, e".
  * Fix a few assorted pyflakes warnings.
  * Use string methods rather than functions from the string module.
  * Replace most uses of filter and map with list comprehensions or for
    loops.
  * Use open() rather than file().
  * Use Python 3 renaming of ConfigParser if available.
  * Use "raise Exception(value)" syntax rather than the old-style "raise
    Exception, value".
  * Remove duplicate imports of os.path; 'import os' is enough.
  * Use Python 3 renamings of urllib, urllib2, and urlparse if available.
  * Remove all hard tabs from Python code.  Python 3 no longer tolerates
    mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.
  * Use Python 3 renaming of httplib if available.
  * Use email.utils.parsedate (with a DST handling correction) rather than
    the long-deprecated rfc822.parsedate.
  * Use the threading module instead of thread (renamed to _thread in Python
    3).
  * Tell Python to use absolute imports by default, and annotate cases where
    we need relative imports.
  * Update test_proxy to use gsettings and the python-apt 0.8 API.
  * Use new-style octal literals.
  * Drop use of deprecated statvfs module.
  * Use Python 3 renamings of BaseHTTPServer and SocketServer if available.
  * Modernise use of unittest methods.
  * Use python-apt 0.8 API spellings of apt_pkg.config methods.
  * Fix several ResourceWarnings with Python 3.
  * Port to python-apt 0.8 progress classes.
  * Since python-gnupginterface is not likely to be ported to Python 3, and
    since it's almost just as easy to call gpg directly via subprocess, do
    so.
  * Use gettext if ugettext does not exist (as in Python 3).
  * Ignore __pycache__ directories, and exclude them from dist-upgrader
    tarballs.
  * Fix up module path when running AutoUpgradeTester/auto-install-tester.py
    from the build tree.
  * Add a DistUpgrade -> . symlink in DistUpgrade/, to make it possible to
    have compatible imports both in update-manager proper and in
    dist-upgrader tarballs.
  * Use only absolute imports in AutoUpgradeTester/auto-install-tester.py
    and DistUpgrade/dist-upgrade.py; these have no __package__ and so cannot
    use relative imports.
  * Open subprocesses with universal_newlines=True when expecting to read
    text from them.  On Python 2, this only enables \r\n conversion and the
    like, but on Python 3 this also causes subprocess-related file objects
    to read str rather than bytes.
  * Use "key in dict" rather than "dict.has_key(key)".
  * Pass globals() to __import__ so that relative imports work.
